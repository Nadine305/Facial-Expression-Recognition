### ðŸ”§ Preprocessing

We apply a series of image enhancements:

* CLAHE (contrast improvement)
* Denoising with Gaussian blur
* Histogram stretching
* Gamma correction
* Sharpening
* Normalization

---

### ðŸ“ˆ Data Augmentation

Each image is augmented using:

* Horizontal flip
* Rotation (Â±15Â°)
* Brightness adjustment

---

### ðŸ§  Feature Extraction

We use:

* **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)**
* **LBP ()**


---

### ðŸ“Š Visualizations

We provide:

* Original vs. preprocessed image comparison
* Class distribution plots

## Dataset

We use the [FER-2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) from Kaggle, which provides labeled facial expression data for training and evaluation.
